# SIGI: Simple Image Gen UI

I primarily wrote this app because I wanted to generate a bunch of images using Stability AI without having to wait for the result.
Just pass in one prompt after the other and have the app call the API and store the result.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the ddl scrip to setup sqlite database
`python dbddl.py`
4. Launch the app
`streamlit run main.py`

## Via Docker

**ToDo: setup docker**
